### When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
MIT licences allow the code to be open source. This way, people can access it publicly and for their own projects. I do not intend on charging others for the use of this code.
### Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
I used the MIT license because its open source.
