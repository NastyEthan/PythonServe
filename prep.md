# Test Prep Plan
## Review Past College Board Exams
* Mock Exam 1, review questions wrong and look at questions similar to those
* Mock Exam 2, review the same process and look at questions similar to those

## Review College Board Videos
* Chapter by chapter, on concepts I'm not as familiar with
* Cross reference with problems missed in each of the mock exams
