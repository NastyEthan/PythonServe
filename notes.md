* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
* Creating software to assist loan officers
* Find trends in successful loans
* Reject those who don’t fit their trends

* Crowdsourcing
## Essential knowledge
* Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
* Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientist, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices

* Public Data Sets
* Kaggle
* Courses in visualizations, machine learning, and more
* Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props

* Local government
* Distributed Computing
* Donate spare computing power to help calculations
* Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom many not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
* Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
* Spotify
* Collaborative playlists
* Algorithm
* Metadata write-in
* Crowdfunding
* Kickstarter
* IndieGoGo
* Blockchain
* Cryptocurrency
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet
* Crowdsourcing offers new models of collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

## Learning objectives
* Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns
## Essential knowledge
* Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization
* Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
* Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
* The use of material created by someone other than you should always be cited
* Creative commons, open source, and open access have enable board access to digital information
* As with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups of people raises legal and ethical concerns
* Intellectual property
* * a work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights
* Copyright
* * Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
* Plagiarism: presenting material as your own
* Legal ways to use material created by someone else
* * Creative Commons
* * Open source
* * Open access
* * Creative Commons
* Creative commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
* Clearly tells others what they can and cannot do with your IP
* Open source and open access
* * Open source: programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
* * Open access: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions

* Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment
* Encryption and Decryption	
* Once legitimate access to a system is gained, it is important to ensure data sent to and from the system remains uncompromised
* Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
* Decryption: the process of decoding data
