# Exam Corrections

## Question 23
### Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy?
* A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser
* The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer
* The user’s e-mail address
* The user’s public key used for encryption

## Correction
I selected B because I initially thought the IP address is important to a computer, but the address itself does not have as much information as cookies stored by the web browser. The cookies have information that the websites can use to track the user's actions (which invades the privacy). This quesiton was less about getting hacked but more about losing privacy.

## Question 24
### Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?*
* Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
* Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.
* Each packet contains only the metadata used to establish a direct connection so that the data can be transmitted.
* Each packet contains multiple data files bundled together, along with metadata describing how to categorize each data file.

## Correction
I selected D because I thought that the data would be sent with data describing that, but I was also thinking between A. D is not the correct answer because the data does not come in packets, and actually routes the data instead.

## Question Q29
### Which of the following is true?
* The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended.
* The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5].
* The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct.
* The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] only confirms that the program works for lists in increasing order.
